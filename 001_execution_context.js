>Everything happens in (Execution context).

>There are two parts of execution context:-
    1) Memory (variable environment)
    2) code (Thread of execution)

* Memory: where every value (string, number, object, function etc)--
    are stored as the key value pair.

* code: This is where code is executed line by line.
